                    <p>
                        I began working initially with a family-owned company who needed help managing the administration side of their fast-growing business.  Although brought on to look after "the books" this quickly led me to find other gaps missing, and ways to help.  My services grew to include emails, phone calls, administration, banking help, and generally running their business on a daily basis so they could concentrate on sales and building bigger.
                        <br> <br>
                        Now I thrive on helping small businesses to grow - helping business owners to build their business by relieving them of the paperwork, and help them to set up systems and processes specifically for their business, and to let them get back to what they do best.
                        <br> <br>
                        I am the first to admit my OCD-like traits, and my need for organisation with t's crossed and i's dotted.  Just ask my husband and kids!  I love putting these skills to use - there's only so much I can use my Dymo labeller on at my place.  And now with the huge advances in technology I have ways to organise your business online to make finding that document or processing that purchase much easier.
